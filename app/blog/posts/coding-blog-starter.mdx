My blog was made with Next.js, using `pnpm create next-app` with a template which supports MDX including syntax highlighting.


Create your own coding blog using [this template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit)

Which supports syntax highlighting...

```ts
const add = (...args) => args.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log('1+2=', add(1,2))
console.log('1+2+3=', add(1,2,3))
```
## Why create a coding blog of your own?

Starting a coding blog offers personal growth, professional development, and community engagement. Writing about programming deepens your knowledge, sharpens communication skills, and builds a portfolio that strengthens your personal brand. A well-curated blog sets you apart in job searches, opens networking opportunities, and can lead to collaborations.

## So where do you start

What does it take to get it set up?

Well, follow the link above to start. It requires `git`, Node.js, and `pnpm`. Mak sure you have `git`. You can get `npm` by installing Node.js. I recommend installing something like node version manager for your operating system, e.g. `windows-nvm` or just `nvm` for linux should work, then you can change `node` version easily and install the `--lts` to get the latest supported `node` (which brings `npm` with it).

Once you have `node` and `npm`, in the terminal, `npm i -g pnpm` to install pnpm globally so you can use `pnpm` anywhere.

## MDX support - your codebase

Storing content in `.mdx` files in a `git` repository makes it easy to organise and use git as a content management system - the content coexists with the code.
